Merged radar signals in typical tropical ecoregions (Olson et al. 2001).

WD is the cumulative water deficit (negative values signifying water stress).
Radar signal is in unit of dB (or, decibel).

'Generalization' in each subset is the generalized change in radar signal calculated using the DBEST algorithm.

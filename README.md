# Radar Rainforest <br/>
**Until June 2021, there has been no well-calibrated C-band microwave (neither active nor passive) data set which measures the structure/moisture of global forests and covers a long time span (since 2000s or earlier).**<br/>   

                   --------------------------  

**The aim of the project Radar Rainforest is**<br/> to provide a calibrated, long-term (since 1992) C-band radar data set for global land areas (currently focusing on tropical rainforests). C-band ERS (1992-2001) and ASCAT (since 2007) data were bridged using Ku-band QuikSCAT data (1999-2009). Several C-band satellite missions are operating (such as Sentinel-1 and ASCAT). Our data set therefore can be extended into future.

                   --------------------------  
**This site provides the Matlab scripts for generating the harmonized long-term (since 1992) C-band radar data set for global tropical rainforests.

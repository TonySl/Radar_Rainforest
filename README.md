# C-band Radar and rainforests
Matlab scripts for generating fully harmonized long-term (since 1992) C-band radar data set for global tropical rainforests.
Mat files related to the scripts are available at: https://filesender.renater.fr/?s=download&token=c0cb8523-76ab-4190-96f3-8cc260c2a67b

Until 2021.02, there has been no well-calibrated C-band microwave (either active or passive) data set covering a long time span. 
There have been C-band passive microwave data from AMSR-E and AMSR2, but they didn't overlap temporally, thus have not been well calibrated (Du et al. 2017. Earth Syst. Sci. Data 9,791–808; Moesinger et al. 2020. Earth Syst. Sci. Data 12, 177–196). 
The aim of Project Radar_Rainforest is to fill this knowledge gap, by providing a fully harmonized, long-term (since 1992) C-band radar data set for global land areas, especially for tropical rainforests.
